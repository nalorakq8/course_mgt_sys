- Push changes to *your* github repository fork
- Send pull request when you push an update, and choose the branch you worked on
- *ALWAYS* work on a new branch for every new feature

# sending a pull request
- After forking the original project, clone your forked project to your local machine
- *ALWAYS* start from branch dev, switch to it using `git checkout dev`
- Create a new branch from branch dev by running `git checkout -b newbranchname`
- After completing and testing your work, commit it
- finally, push your new branch to your forked project using `git push origin newbranchname`
- Got ot github, issue a pull request to the almarzouq/course_mgt_sys (branch dev)

# Working with the most recent copy of the dev branch
- *IMPORTANT* after forking the project, create a remote called upstream:
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/almarzouq/course_mgt_sys.git
- Before creating any branch, switch to branch dev, and run `git pull upstream dev`
  This will update the dev to match what is on the project dev repository so
